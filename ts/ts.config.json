{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
i'm not sure if we must define the paths. but after write baseUrl to src i can import all folder under src folder like this

import { Home } from "pages";
import { formatDate } from "utils";
import { Navbar } from "components";
don't forget to restart your terminal after change the tsconfig.json



We can avoid the "../../../../../" its looking odd and not readable too.

So Typescript config file have answer for the same. Just specify the baseUrl, config will take care of your relative path.

way to config: tsconfig.json file add the below properties.

"baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@app/*": [ "app/*" ],
      "@env/*": [ "environments/*" ]
    }
So Finally it will look like below

import { Something } from "@app/src/[browser/server/universal]/...";
